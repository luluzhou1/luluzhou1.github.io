### Projects related to blockchain
1. Ethereum Fast Confirmation Rule
   * Implemented the Ethereum Fast Confirmation Rule, tested its security and performance using real Ethereum data collected from the Beacon API, and authored blog posts to explain the rule and test results clearly.
   * Advanced research and promoted the adoption of the Fast Confirmation Rule, enhancing the security of Ethereum.
2. ZK Proof Accelerator
   * Modified the snarkjs and ffjavascript packages to implement dynamic caching for ZK-Login.
   * Accelerated the MSM process in ZK proof by 15\% and reduced the total proof generation time by 3\%.
  
3. TEE Wallet
   * Developed a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)-based wallet for secure secret key management, employing OAuth to ensure an accountable authorization process.
   * Enhanced security using insurance and bounty incentives, and evaluated the solution's effectiveness using a MDP model.
  
4. Sprints
   * Developed "Sprints," a blockchain protocol combining PoW and PoD to reduce ecological impact while maintaining security.
   * Validated its security through performance testing with patched Bitcoin clients.

5. Transaction Relay Strategy
   * Analyzed optimal transaction relaying in Payment Channel Networks (PCNs) using MDP to optimize relay policies.
   * Developed an algorithm for optimal relay strategies in PCNs, assessing the impact on network performance.

1. Analysis of blockchain mining strategy based on MDP
  * This project aims to analyse the best way to mining in proof of work blockchain in order to make maximum profit.
